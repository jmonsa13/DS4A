### Natural Disaster Projection due to Climate Change Effects.

Climate change is a reality. It affects us all and it will be more impactful in the coming years. One of the factors that will increase are natural disasters related to climate change. These disasters generate high human and economic costs which can be mitigated with proper preparation. Understanding the effect of external factors such as climate change over natural disasters  is vital to generate strategies to diminish such costs.
Visualizing the frequency and location of natural disasters and their possible correlation with climate change will allow the world to prepare for future events.
